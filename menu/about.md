Hi, I'm DÅ¾oka and this is my personal blog. I work as a software developer using Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Powershell, C# and F#. I'm currently learning F# and functional programming.
[Jan Hoek](https://twitter.com/uncommonsensenl) asked me whether I was blogging about my progress with F# and I thought "hm, why not?" So let's start with this little experiment and see where this journey goes.
