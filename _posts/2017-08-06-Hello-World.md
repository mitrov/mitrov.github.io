The first thing every software developer writes is "hello world". OK, now that I have that behind me, let me quickly introduce myself. I speak (Swiss-)German, Macedonian and English. I enjoy mountainbiking, snowboarding and riding my longboard. I love to travel and I travel a lot. I work as a software developer and have been a [Microsoft Dynamics NAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_NAV) developer since 2002. Besides NAV I do C#, Powershell I'm in the process of learning some functional programming with F#.
